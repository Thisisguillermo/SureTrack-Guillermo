*"Personally, I think trying to apply modern development practice to wordpress development is a waste of time. You're going to fight an uphill battle. Instead, just treat it as a legacy platform and use legacy development methodology: have at least two or three copies of the site (dev, staging and production). Use sftp to live edit the code on dev/staging, then copy to production regularly. Make sure to have a versioned daily backup in place which at least can pull the last 7 days daily backup and the last 6 months monthly backups, and you're set. If your app is getting too complex for this development method, you can always switch back to django or other modern frameworks with modern tooling."*

*"I agree with this approach. Fortunately, there are managed services specifically for Wordpress that handle all this stuff. Cloudways, WPEngine, there are several others too. Cloudways lets you set up and manage WP using Digital Ocean, Vultr, AWS or GCP if I recall."*

*"I suggest going through the VIP docs as well as they have some really good advice on securing and speeding up wordpress along with what to avoid. https://docs.wpvip.com/technical-references/ Also just a tip: https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards"*
