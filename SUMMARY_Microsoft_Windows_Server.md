# Microsoft Defender

WD is no longer only signature based! All next gen protection capabilities like machine learning models are included with the free WD version. things that are only in the premium version have to do with hardening, enterprise features, reporting, EDR, automation & adv sandboxing.

regardless of what peopls choose, just remember that signature based detection just doesn't cut it anymore. Even with Microsoft Defender, you need to pay for the next gen (Advanced Threat protection) level to catch today's threats.

For relatives that are more prone to installing junk software bundlers, Windows Defender has protections for it that are only intended for Enterprise customers.

However, you can force it on with this PowerShell:

`Set-MpPreference -PUAProtection enable`

# Windows VHD

"This brings up an interesting question.

My company won't give me a newer laptop.  Could I make a VHD out of my work laptop and run it as a VM on a much more powerful computer?"

Generally yes. Keep in mind your PC has tons of junk drivers you’ll need to uninstall/remove from Autoruns later to improve performance.

Note this is a transition of logical data into a VHD within a running system, Bitlocker and all that doesn’t matter.

# BIOS updates

See, what do I tell y’all? BIOS updates. Update your BIOS. As someone here once told me, “Absolutely no company releases new firmware updates for fun. If it’s public, there’s a very good reason.”
I updated Dell BIOS on thousands of systems in my helpdesk role.
