## Vagrant

Vagrant is for development environments.

Vagrant provides a number of higher level features that Terraform doesn't. Synced folders, automatic networking, HTTP tunneling, and more are features provided by Vagrant to ease development environment usage. Because Terraform is focused on infrastructure management and not development environments, these features are out of scope for that project.

## Back-upp vagrant boxes

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43411734/correct-way-to-back-up-and-restore-vagrant-box-variable-vvv

You can package your working VM into a new vagrant box

`vagrant package --output ./new-box-name.box`

`vagrant package`

and then backup this box

After you reinstall your Mackbook, you can then add this box to your local vagrant directory

`vagrant box add new-box-name ./new-box-name.box`

`vagrant box add package.box --name yourname_box`

After that you initiate the vagrantfile through

`vagrant init newbox`

`vagrant init yourname_box`

`vagrant up`
