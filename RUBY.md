## Ruby GEM (https://rubygems.org/) like NPM

*RubyGems.org is the Ruby communityâ€™s gem hosting service. Instantly publish your gems and then install them. Use the API to find out more about available gems. Become a contributor and improve the site yourself.*

**When you do gem install, it will search the current directory first, so if your .gem file is there, it will pick it up. I found it on the gem reference, which you may find handy as well:**

*gem install will install the named gem. It will attempt a local installation (i.e. a .gem file in the current directory), and if that fails, it will attempt to download and install the most recent version of the gem you want.*

## Ruby Bundler (https://bundler.io/)

*Bundler provides a consistent environment for Ruby projects by tracking and installing the exact gems and versions that are needed.Bundler is an exit from dependency hell, and ensures that the gems you need are present in development, staging, and production. Starting work on a project is as simple as bundle install.*
