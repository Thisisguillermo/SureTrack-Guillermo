# Learning programming advice.

Actually before writing a program, if you have no clue how to start, this is what I do (idk if it works for others but I do it this way)
First you sketch the thing out. Like visually. What you can see as a user.
Then you go in one level at a time. What data structure you need? What maths you need to do?
The data structure part is very important, and is very often overlooked by new programmers.
You get that wrong, and you'll end up rewriting your thing when you want to do something but your current structure says no.
Like, you want to build a pong game (or whatever that is called)
So first, you need a board to draw your things.
Then, you need two plates. They needs to be controlled.
Then you want to know where the plates are so that you can know if the ball should bounce off them or should hit the edge and end the game
So naturally, you need the coordinates in a data structure that you can associate with the plates.
Or in the plates itself, if you make it into a class (I'll almost make everything into classes... that's a habit after learning C++)
Most of the time you'll be spending on is to tinker around on how you want to tear down your program's bits and determine what each part should have, and how parts should be related to each other (x calls y, y reads from z, etc). After that it's just a matter of flex taping them up correctly and boom, it works.
(Hopefully, otherwise have fun debugging but it's going to be fine assuming that your data structure is correct for your plan)
And yeah, use a notebook if your program is slightly big. It helps. And don't worry if you find yourself repeating the structure designing phase because it's always like this.


Umm well I follow this method when it comes to make the code do what I want it to - (I only use it in big stuff because it is also like a mind map)

1) Think about the program in depth
2) Think about the methods
3) Write a pseudo code
4) Start fucking writing the code

In the Python world I've heard good things about http://www.openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/

You know when I started, I watched Sentdex's Python tutorials in which he taught beginner concepts by teaching you how to make a complex tic-tac-toe

A lot of programming revolves around the mindset and problem solving, so going through at least one thorough programming book / guide will help you a lot in being able to tackle a full scale project

That's not cheating to be honest
When you are at the early stage of learning then you require these kind of beginner projects
Remember when you were learning poems in kindergarten? Did you make your own poems or first learn the poems made by others?
And when it comes to programming, the search engine is your best friend and sites like Stack Overflow are your girlfriend (s)
When it comes to videos (as you asked), I like the ones made by Sentdex and thenewboston
As for the books, I read - Sam Teaches C in 21 days, Learning Python 5ed by Mark Lutz, Python Cookbook 3ed etc
And for the something part you asked - Try reading source codes to build up understanding about what the program does (tbh, I suck at it) and solve some cool short problem which are available on the internet.

it takes time to get used to thinking algorithmically and reading example code will of course be much easier than writing it at first
But there's no way around using tutorials, books, etc.
Ideas for projects will come naturally as you think of things that bother you that you think you can automate.

I recommend new coders don't copy/paste code but actually re-type it line by line. To me, that helps you to notice each symbol, character, etc. Plus, you'll make typos which is a good introduction to debugging. (See an error, figure out the line it refers to, compare your code to their code).  I remember stuff better if I read->write vs just read/copying n lines at once.

There's a difference between "copy pasting" and "looking up something on stackoverflow, understanding what it does, and retyping it / reimplementing it in your code"
Besides, a significant amount of develops do tend to copy tidbits of code here and there
There's no need to reinvent the wheel everytime you do something.

Try python first it's a lil bit easy to program in it
It's more beginner friendly
