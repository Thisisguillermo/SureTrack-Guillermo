Oxygen Builder
#### WordPress theme

**Hello Elementor**
 *Hello Elementor is a WordPress theme built for the Elementor website builder platform. It uses minimal styling and scripts for maximum speed and design freedom.*


#### Notes

You could try using a headless CMS combined with something like Gatsby.
Should be faster and more customizable than wordpress.


#### Why not use Magento here (Google translate Dutch to English because of laziness)

*WooCommerce is fine for all those things too. There is also an API in WooCommerce
And can therefore also be linked to all those platforms, just like Magento.
Magento has also not built in a direct link with all those platforms and you also have to invest in connectors or customization.
And the prices for plugins from Magento are usually immensely more expensive than the Wordpress ecosystem.*
