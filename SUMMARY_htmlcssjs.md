# HTML/CSS/JS Notes

## TIL that you're not supposed to put external links in your <nav> elements. 
TL;DR: Only use nofollow if you actively think the destination doesn't deserve Google's attention. Use noopener and/or noreferrer for security.
*So if it's another website I control and want to endorse, I leave the link bare?*
*Yes, definitely.*
