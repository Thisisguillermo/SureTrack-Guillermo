Google doesn't care as much about keyword density as it used to. Here's how I usually approach this:

    Include kw in article title

    Include kw in the introduction of the article

    Aim for a keyword density of 0.5%. While Google did say they don't care about this anymore, it's still a best practice

    Sprinkle LSI keywords throughout the post

    Once your page starts getting some rankings, check what keywords it's ranking for on Search Console. Then, sprinkle these keywords throughout the article
