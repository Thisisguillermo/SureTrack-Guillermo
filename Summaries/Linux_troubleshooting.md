Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing.

`netcat`

Is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.

`procfs`

The  proc  filesystem  is  a  pseudo-filesystem  which provides an interface to kernel data structures.

`strace`

A Linux command that can help you with error analysis. By default it will output every syscall a process does.
There is no tool that "drills down" deeper on this analysis than strace. By this it is comparable to.

## Profiling

In software engineering, profiling ("program profiling", "software profiling") is a form of dynamic program analysis that measures, for example, the space (memory) or time complexity of a program, the usage of particular instructions, or the frequency and duration of function calls. Most commonly, profiling information serves to aid program optimization.
